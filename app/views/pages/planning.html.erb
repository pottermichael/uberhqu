          Abandoned rail corridor makes way for a tech enabled mobility corridor. Early 2000's (articically restricted) So why does downtown just stop right here? Why does this happen in any city for that matter. Uber's new Campus is enabling the Cityâ€™s "North Branch Transitway" in partnership with the Chicago Department of Transportation. The new pedestrian and Bus Rapid Transit connection creates an off street right of way between our campus and the West Loop, most notably to connect with Ogilvie Station and Union Station. Phase 1 of the Transitway is anticipated to be complete in the next 3-5 years.

          The corridor is anticipated to be 3 miles in length upon completion. Future phases of the Transitway will connect the campus north through Goose Island to residential neighborhoods of Lincoln Park and Bucktown and is planned to terminate near the Clybourn Metra station.

          The multi-modal trail is planned for use by pedestrians, bicycle and a new bus rapid transit system. The pathway is predominantly comprised of old freight rail lines that are no longer in service and will be repurposed for modern use. These rail corridors create a unique opportunity for the City to establish a dedicated right-of-way for a new high capacity transit system for the North Branch that creates new connections and reduces reliance on vehicular modes.
