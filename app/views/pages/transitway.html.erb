          United's new campus FEATURES will be the catalyst for a new "North Branch Transitway" in partnership with the City of Chicago and Department of Transportation. The new pedestrian and Bus Rapid Transit connection between our campus and commuter rails of Ogilive and Union Stations. Phase 1 of the Transitway is anticipated to be complete near United's occupancy at the beginning of 2023. Future phases will connect the campus north through Goose Island to residential neighborhoods of Lincoln Park and Bucktown. For suburban commuters, the Transitway will connect to the Cylbourn Metra stop north of the site.
