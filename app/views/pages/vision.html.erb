          The riverfront parcel on which United’s new campus is located is part of a larger 37-acre landholding that has previously been restricted from high-density development due to outdated zoning policy in place since the 1980’s.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, Chicago has grown up all around the site and is just now beginning to recognize the full potential and draw of the riverfront for work and leisure activities. Today, the attraction and success of recent civic projects such as the City’s main branch riverwalk and privately funded large-scale office and residential developments at the river’s confluence is undeniable.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the first site to receive approvals under the City’s modernized zoning framework, United is taking advantage of the unique opportunity to secure a 7-acre site and create an urban campus that exactly meets operational requirements and plans for future growth. Adjacent zoning and planing directly north and south of the site have further laid the groundwork for a new +40 acre 'city within the city' to emerge on the North Branch.

            Located along the North Branch of the Chicago River, our new Riverfront Campus is situated among Chicago’s most dynamic downtown neighborhoods: West Loop, Fulton Market and River North. At the corner of Chicago Avenue and Halsted Street, the site is serviced by the City’s highest frequency mass transit infrastructure for convenient access by City employees. For Suburban employees, the site will operate a partially “off-street” shuttle to Ogilvie Station and Union Station which is planned to be replaced by a dedicated transit corridor for the City’s 3-mile “North Branch Transitway” that is being delivered in partnership with Chicago Department of Transportation and Uber.

          In conjunction with the delivery of our Riverfront Campus, Uber is proud to announce a partnership with the City of Chicago’s Department of Transportation to catalyze the new 3 mile “North Branch Transitway.” Designed as a pedestrian/ bike friendly trail and Bus Rapid Transit, the new mobility corridor runs along obsolete freight rails and is a critical component of Chicago’s downtown expansion moving north.
        </p>
        <p>
          In cities all across the U.S., a decades long trend of urbanization and rapid population growth have combined to make working and living downtown more exciting than ever. Chicago is no exception. As conventional downtown cores expand, cities are looking for new ways to move people around quickly and efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
         Uber Freight’s Riverfront Campus will not only benefit from the robust mass transit options that Chicago is known for, but also provides an opportunity to work with the City to deliver the North Branch Transitway and is also partnering with the CDOT for deployment milestones for the rapidly emerging suite of products and services within the Advanced Technology Group.
